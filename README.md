Weekly tasks for ATU Programming and Scripting module

# firstprog.py
Straightforward exercise in learning to print to console

# bank.py
Found it straightforward to define the eurovalue of the output by dividing as integer, but had a few issues when trying to define centvalue as remainder
Used string splicing to pull centvalue as last two characters, but this still caused an anomoly when total value was < 10
Used an IF function to account for anomaly which runs when total is < 10

# accounts.py
Defined input as a string, spliced last four characters, and printed output as XXXXXX{digits}
Will try to code it to deal with account numbers of any length - achieved
As a separate task, will attempt to add an error message if account number of wrong length is input - working on it
